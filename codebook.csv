Researcher's Contact Information:  

Thomas J. Hodges, 470-418-4810, thodges7@students.kennesaw.edu



You are being asked to take part in a research study. The information in this form will help you decide if you want to be in the study. Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information. 



Description of Project

The reason for the research is to learn the extent to which moral injuries affect reintegration. Although there will be no direct benefit to you for taking part in this study, the researcher may learn more about how to help veterans who will have the most difficulty post-service and target assistance appropriately. The findings of this research will be published and presented to people working to improve veteran health and well-being.



Explanation of Procedures

If you agree to participate in this study:



You will complete a survey online which contains a series of questionnaires that ask about your military background, including experiences with moral injury, identity, military service, and other aspects of your psychology, health, social life, and demographics. In total, this will take about 15 minutes. 



Participation is voluntary. You can refuse to take part or stop at any time without penalty. There is no consequence for choosing not to participate or for stopping the survey. You will not be required to provide any personal identification information, and the results of your participation will be anonymous.



Risks or Discomforts

Overall, this study has minimal risks. There are no physical, legal, or reputational risks from participating. Participation is anonymous. No personally identifiable information will be collected by the researcher.



There is a possibility of minor psychological discomfort or stress from participating in this research. You will be asked about your experiences in the military and after leaving the military, including incidents which may have caused psychological wounds and extreme stress. However, to minimize this discomfort, you can choose not to participate, and if you do decide to participate, you can pause or stop the survey at any time without any penalty whatsoever. You are not under orders to participate in the study or complete the survey.



Additionally, here are some free services that you can contact at any point:

	If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org
	SAMHSA’s National Helpline is a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service (in English and Spanish) for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders. Also, visit the online treatment locator. Call: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)

These resources will be provided again at the end of the survey, regardless of how you answer the survey questions.



Benefits

Although there will be no direct benefit to you for taking part in this study, the researcher may learn more about how to help veterans who will have the most difficulty post-service and target assistance appropriately. The findings of this research will be published and presented to people working to improve veteran health and well-being.



Confidentiality

The results of participation will be anonymous, and no personally identifiable information will be collected by the researcher.



The information gained from the study will be shared with other researchers upon request to contribute to scientific transparency, and it may also be used for future studies. In either instance, no additional consent will be sought from you. 



Research at Kennesaw State University that involves human participants is carried out under the oversight of an Institutional Review Board.  Questions or problems regarding these activities should be addressed to the Institutional Review Board, Kennesaw State University, irb@kennesaw.edu. This email address will be provided to you again at the end of the survey.
