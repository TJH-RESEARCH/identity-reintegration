### Moral Injury and Reintegration: 
### The Mediating Role of Identity

# Hypotheses ----------------------------------------------------

H1: Moral injury symptoms negatively predicts quality of reintegration.

H2: Higher bicultural blendedness predicts better reintegration outcomes.

H3: Higher bicultural harmony predicts better reintegration outcomes.

H4: Identity (WIS, civilian identity, bicultural blendedness, and identity conflict) mediate the relationship between moral injury and reintegration.

H4a: Miilitary identity mediates the relationship between moral injury and reintegration.

H4b: Civilian identity mediates the relationship between moral injury and reintegration.

H4c: Bicultural identity blendedness mediates the relationship between moral injury and reintegration.

H4d: Bicultural identity harmony mediates the relationship between moral injury and reintegration.


# Analysis Plan -------------------------------------------------

1. Mediation Analysis using Structural Equation Modelling

a. dags
b. correlation
c. check assumptions
d. run Model 1
- Regress MCARM on MIOS without mediators
e. run Model 2
- Regress MCARM on MIOS with mediators
- calculate direct and indirect effects
f. inspect residual plots of individual regressions 







What to do about the identity variables as mediators. There are several directly affected by the independent variable, and one affected by those. 

First order identity:
- WIS
- Civilian Identity

Second order identity:
- Identity conflict
- Identity compartmentalization


# Correlation analysis
# Cluster the identity variables?
# Then regression modeo for direct and indirect effect


....

1. Regress MCARM on BIIS.
- DAGs for adjustment sets and precision covariates.
- Check regression assumptions. 
- Transform variables.
- Run regression.
- Check diagnostics.

3-4. ANOVA
- Create categories of military-civilian identity.
- Check ANOVA assumptions.
- Run ANOVA of BIIS by military-civilian identity categories.
- Post-hoc paired t-Tests.



Future study:
H2: Self Concept Clarity moderates the relationship between bicultural identity integration and reintegration outcomes.


2. Moderation analysis of SCC on BIIS->MCARM.
- Run regression with interaction term.
- Check diagnostics.
