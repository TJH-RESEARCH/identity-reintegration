### Moral Injury and Reintegration: 
### The Mediating Role of Identity

# Hypotheses ----------------------------------------------------

H1: Moral injury negatively predicts quality of reintegration.

H2: Higher bicultural blendedness predicts better reintegration outcomes.

H3: Higher bicultural harmony predicts better reintegration outcomes.

H4: Identity (WIS, civilian identity, bicultural blendedness, and identity conflict) mediate the relationship between moral injury and reintegration.


# Analysis Plan -------------------------------------------------


What to do about the identity variables as mediators. There are several directly affected by the independent variable, and one affected by those. 

First order identity:
- WIS
- Civilian Identity

Second order identity:
- Identity conflict
- Identity compartmentalization


# Correlation analysis
# Cluster the identity variables?
# Then regression modeo for direct and indirect effect


....

1. Regress MCARM on BIIS.
- DAGs for adjustment sets and precision covariates.
- Check regression assumptions. 
- Transform variables.
- Run regression.
- Check diagnostics.

3-4. ANOVA
- Create categories of military-civilian identity.
- Check ANOVA assumptions.
- Run ANOVA of BIIS by military-civilian identity categories.
- Post-hoc paired t-Tests.



Future study:
H2: Self Concept Clarity moderates the relationship between bicultural identity integration and reintegration outcomes.


2. Moderation analysis of SCC on BIIS->MCARM.
- Run regression with interaction term.
- Check diagnostics.
