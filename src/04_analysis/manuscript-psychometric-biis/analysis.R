# Hypotheses -----------------------------------------------------------

## H1: Higher Bicultural Identity Integration predicts 
##     better reintegration outcomes. 

## H2: Self Concept Clarity moderates the relationship between
##     bicultural identity integration and reintegration outcomes.

## H3: Veterans with both high military identity and high 
##     civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural 
##     identity integration than others. 

## H4: Veterans with both low military identity and low 
##     civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural 
##     identity integration than others. 


# Analysis Plan -----------------------------------------------------------

##      Establish validity of BIIS to measure
##        military-civilian identity dissonance.

##      DAGs for adjustment sets and precision covariates.

##      Check regression assumptions. Transform variables.
##   1. Regress MCARM on BIIS.
##      Check diagnostics.

##   2. Moderation analysis of SCC on BIIS->MCARM.
##      Check diagnostics.

## 3-4. Create categories of military-civilian identity.

##      Check ANOVA assumptions.
## 3-4. ANOVA BIIS by military-civilian identity categories.
## 3-4. Post-hoc paired t-Tests.
