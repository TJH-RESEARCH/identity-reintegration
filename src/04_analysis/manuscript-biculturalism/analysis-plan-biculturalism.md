Biculturalism

# Hypotheses ----------------------------------------------------


H1: Higher Bicultural Identity Integration predicts better reintegration outcomes. 

H2: Higher bicultural blendedness predicts better reintegration outcomes.

H3: Higher bicultural harmony predicts better reintegration outcomes.

H4: Veterans with both high military identity and high civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural blendedness than others. 

H5: Veterans with both high military identity and high civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural harmony than others. 

H6: Veterans with both low military identity and low civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural blendedness than others. 

H7: Veterans with both low military identity and low civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural harmony than others. 




# Analysis Plan -------------------------------------------------

Establish validity of BIIS to measure military-civilian identity dissonance.


- establish validity of measures
- dimension reduction on the WIS subscales (i.e., clustering and/or summing) 
-- justify the choice and note limitations
- regressions:
-- mcarm on biis harmony + biis conflict
-- biss scales on wis interacting with civilian identity






1. Regress MCARM on BIIS.
- DAGs for adjustment sets and precision covariates.
- Check regression assumptions. 
- Transform variables.
- Run regression.
- Check diagnostics.

3-4. ANOVA
- Create categories of military-civilian identity.
- Check ANOVA assumptions.
- Run ANOVA of BIIS by military-civilian identity categories.
- Post-hoc paired t-Tests.



Future study:
H2: Self Concept Clarity moderates the relationship between bicultural identity integration and reintegration outcomes.


2. Moderation analysis of SCC on BIIS->MCARM.
- Run regression with interaction term.
- Check diagnostics.
