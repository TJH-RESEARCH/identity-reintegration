### Military-Civilian Biculturalism?: 
### Bicultural Identity and the Adjustment of Separated Service Members


#### Hypotheses

H1: Veterans with both high military identity and high civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural blendedness than others. 

H2: Veterans with both high military identity and high civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural harmony than others. 

H3: Veterans with both low military identity and low civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural blendedness than others. 

H4: Veterans with both low military identity and low civilian identity have higher levels of bicultural harmony than others. 


#### Analysis Plan

1. Establish validity of Measures
- BIIS to measure military-civilian identity dissonance.
- Civilian Commitment to measure civilian identity dissonance.
- WIS subscales? 

2. Regressions:
a. DAG analysis
-- exposures: WIS and Civilian identity.
-- outcomes: biis harmony and biis blended
-- backdoor paths are unconditionally closed
-- no additional variables should be added. There are no additional parents of dependent variables.: "As a general rule of thumb, parents of X which are not necessary for identification are harmful for the asymptotic variance of the estimator; on the other hand, parents of Y which do not spoil identification are beneficial (Cinelli et al., 2020, p. 7)."

b. Correlation Analysis

c. Models
- Check regression assumptions
- Transform variables
- Run regression models:
-- Model 1: biis blended on WIS subscale and Civilian ID
-- Model 2: biis harmony  on WIS subscale and Civilian ID
-- Model 3: interaction? or ANOVA
- Check diagnostics
